# Grasp

_Grasp_ is a small lib to help you to debug clojure code.
Keeps the spirit of print based debug, that I'm a proponent of, 
but with a twist that the clojure give us, and instead of printing arguments,
return valus and exceptions, we _grab_ to look at later and better _grasp_ what's happening.
